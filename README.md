My name is Son (Sean) Pham and I'm a Vietnamese Software Engineer, working in the Bay Area since 2016. Previously I studied Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas.

I specialize in backend stacks, databases, data processing pipelines, validation, compliance and life cycle.

I am currently the Tech Lead for [Takeout infrastructure](https://takeout.google.com/) ([data portability](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/data-portability/)) and [regionalized batch data processing](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/announcing-sovereign-controls-for-google-workspace) (data compliance) for Google Chat.
